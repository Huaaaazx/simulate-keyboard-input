Self-driving cars are a new type of transportation tool that achieves autonomous driving through intelligent systems. They rely on sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence algorithms to perceive road conditions and automatically perform operations such as acceleration, braking, and steering. These vehicles can be applied in scenarios like urban commuting and logistics delivery, effectively reducing traffic accidents caused by human error, alleviating traffic congestion, and improving travel efficiency. At present, many countries have conducted tests on self-driving cars. As the technology continues to mature, self-driving cars will become an essential part of smart transportation in the future, bringing more convenience to people's lives.
